            <h2 class="leading-7 text-sm text-gray-300">Tolerance is accepting people who are different from you or
              putting
              up with things you don't like. Being a tolerant person isn't easy.
              It's OK to keep to your own principles, but it's also a good idea to
              review them, especially if they have an impact on others. It must be
              apparent that everyone has their own beliefs and ideas, which must
              be respected and appreciated. Tolerance is the only option if we
              want to live in a peaceful society.</h2>
